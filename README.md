This project is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, one of the oldest known encryption techniques. The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It allows users to encrypt (encode) or decrypt (decode) messages using a custom shift value.

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Recreate a classical encryption method.
2. Practice Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions.
3. Demonstrate basic concepts of cryptography and user interaction.

How it works:
1. The user chooses whether to encode or decode a message.
2. The user enters a message and a shift number.
3. The program shifts each letter in the message by the given number, wrapping around the alphabet.
4. The result is printed to the screen.
